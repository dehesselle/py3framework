# relocatable `Python.framework`

## Motivation

Although you can download an official Python 3 framework build from https://www.python.org, it's not usable to be bundled with an app as it is not relocatable: libraries point to hard-coded locations below `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework`. So I'm creating my own relocatable version of `Python.framework` to be used (and bundled) in other projects.

## Build from sources

TBD
